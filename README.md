# basic-calculator
This program is a simple calculator I coded in Python. It allows the user to select from a variety of arithmetic operations, which is performed on user-inputted  values, and the result is printed to the screen. The calculator works indefinitely, allowing repeat use without having to restart the program. There are 11 functions, and a stop command.

This is technically my first "official" Python project. I have had some amount of help from online resources (youtube/chatgpt) however all code here is written by me for the most part (had to look up a few commands but it's all my work still).
